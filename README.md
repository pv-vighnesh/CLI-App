# CLI-App
This is the my first App in NodeJS. This is a simple CLI Application.

Step #1 :

Using Built-in JS module for taking input data from the Users.
var readlineSync = require('readline-sync');

Adding a Welcome message and asking for Username.

Step #2:

Using keyInYN() function for displaying a (Y/N) promt. 

User will have the option to chose whether they want to play the game or not.

If the user choses to play the game, serise of questions will be asked and for every correct answer, points will be added and displayed.

To-do: If the user choses the wrong answer, then game will stop displaying the final score of the user.

To-do: Displaying the Scoreboard at the end of the game, based on the highest scores.

To-do: Try to add a nice GUI.
